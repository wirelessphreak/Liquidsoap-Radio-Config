# Liquidsoap-Radio-Config
This is my first attempt at using Liquidsoap to stream my online radio station via Icecast.

After running into support issues with ezstream I started looking at some alternatives. Liquidsoap has become a prominent tool for online radio stations. To be fair my radio station is super basic, before liquid soap ezstream was streaming only one .m3u playlist. No with liquidsoap I am barely scratching the surface of what this tool can do.
